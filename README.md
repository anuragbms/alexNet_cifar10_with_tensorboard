An implementation of the AlexNet Architecture for image classification on the CIFAR-10 Dataset.

The implementation uses tensorflow for the bare minimum tasks (creating the network and training it), while other tasks (such as supplying data) is done using numpy. Helps clearly understand the AlexNet architecture.

The implementation also uses logging for view in tensorboard.
